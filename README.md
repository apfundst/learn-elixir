# Learn Elixir by Example

## Setup

Before you start you will need to have elixir installed. I recommend using `asdf` to install elixir.

Follow the [`asdf` installation guide](https://asdf-vm.com/#/core-manage-asdf-vm)

Then install erlang by running on OSx:

```sh
asdf plugin-add erlang https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-erlang.git
brew install autoconf
brew install wxmac
asdf install erlang <version>
```

Then install elixir by running:

```sh
asdf plugin-add elixir https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-elixir.git
```

## Projects

The projects folder has 3 sub folders: easy, medium, hard. As the name suggests, they contain problems of relative difficulty.

Each project will have a `problem.md` which will outline the problem that the project will solve. It will also have a `help.md` which will contain tips for solving the problem. A soltion folder will also be available for each project
