## Docs

Elixir has an extensive library for dealing with data types like [Strings](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/String.html#content) and [Lists](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/List.html#content). Some common functions for dealing with list like data are under [Enum](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Enum.html#content).

## Implementation

Basic solution is to split the string into an array and sort that array. From there is should be a simple `==` comparison.
