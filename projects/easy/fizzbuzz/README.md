# Fizzbuzz

Write a function that takes a list of numbers and returns an array containing this logic:
```
For each multiple of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number. 
For each multiple of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number. 
For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.
```

Write `Fizzbuzz.run/1` so that `mix test` passes
