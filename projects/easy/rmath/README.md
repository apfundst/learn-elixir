# Recursive Math

The goal of this project is to write recursive math problems.

## Factotial
The product of an integer and all the integers below it; e.g. factorial four ( 4! ) is equal to 24.

Write `Rmath.factorial/1` so that `mix test` passes

## Fibonacci
Fibonacci sequence is a sequence such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1.  

`0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...`

The next number is calculated by adding up the two numbers before it.

Write `Rmath.fibonacci/1` so that `mix test` passes
